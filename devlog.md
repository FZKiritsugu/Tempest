- noticed an issue with the linux implant, maybe present in the windows implant as well, have not confirmed. basically, commands sent from conduit must be getting stripped of all / characters, which means you can never successfully launch a program using the sh command from the linux implant (such as sh ./program) as the / and maybe the period gets stripped away. Shouldn't be a hard fix, but was probably a crappy solution to some other problem I had previously, so I'll likely need to fix something else as well.
- everything tested fine today in the public release, however, I did notice one issue, the conduit client was having issues displaying output from implants and required a couple of restarts. this could be nothing, but if it occurs again, I'll need to take a deeper look at that.
- mac implant will get encryption routines added this week, to get it working with the current version of the server.
- fixed some minor errors in anvil. theres 1 warning left, which I'll address this week.
- added .gitignore files for conduit and Anvil. not sure how they got left out of release, but there's probably some more stuff like that missing to re-introduce after moving repo from private to public.
